Thank you for downloading gro!

To run gro, simply double click the gro icon in this folder.

IMPORTANT: The examples and include folders need to be in the same directory as the gro
application. If, for example, you copy just gro into your Applications folder and then
run it, gro will not know where the examples and include folders are and you will get
errors.
